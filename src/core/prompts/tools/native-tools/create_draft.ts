import type OpenAI from "openai"

const CREATE_DRAFT_DESCRIPTION = `Create a temporary, in-memory planning document that appears as an editor tab but is not saved to disk. These documents use a special draft:// URI scheme and are discarded when the editor session ends. This enables creating planning documents, implementation plans, and other ephemeral working documents for structured thinking.

The created document will:
- Appear as a normal editor tab that can be edited by the user
- Be accessible via read_file and write_to_file tools using the returned draft:// path
- Be automatically discarded when the editor session ends (not saved to disk)

Parameters:
- title: (required) The title/name of the draft document. Will be used as the filename (automatically adds .md extension if not present)
- content: (required) The initial content of the draft document

Example: Creating a planning document
{ "title": "implementation-plan", "content": "# Implementation Plan\n\n## Step 1\n- Task A\n- Task B\n\n## Step 2\n- Task C" }

Example: Creating a quick note
{ "title": "quick-notes", "content": "Remember to:\n1. Check API documentation\n2. Test edge cases\n3. Update tests" }`

const TITLE_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `The title/name of the draft document. Will be used as the filename (automatically adds .md extension if not present)`

const CONTENT_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `The initial content of the draft document`
